## What is GitHub?
GitHub is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration. It allows multiple developers to work on projects simultaneously while keeping track of all changes to the code. GitHub is built on Git, a distributed version control system.

## Creating a Repository
1. Log in to GitHub.
2. Click the green **New** button on the **Repositories** tab.
3. Enter a repository name and description.
4. Select "Public" or "Private."
5. Click **Create Repository**.

---

## Forking a Repository
Forking allows you to copy someone else’s repository into your account.
1. Navigate to the repository you want to fork.
2. Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner.
3. The forked repository will appear under your GitHub account.

## Cloning a Repository
Cloning downloads the repository to your local machine for offline work.
1. Go to the repository page.
2. Click the green **Code** button.
3. Copy the HTTPS or SSH link.
4. Run the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-link>

## Making Changes Locally
To make changes to a repository on your local machine:
1. Navigate to the repository folder on your computer.
2. Open the files using your preferred text editor or IDE (e.g., VSCode, Sublime, or nano).
3. Make the desired changes to the files.
4. Add the changed files to the Git staging area using the command:
   ```bash
   git add <filename>
5. Commit changes with a message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Your commit message"

## Pushing Changes to GitHub

Once changes have been committed locally, you can push them to the remote repository on GitHub:

1. Use the following command to push the changes:
    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```
    Replace `main` with your branch name if you're not working directly on the `main` branch.

2. After pushing, your changes will be visible in the GitHub repository.

## Submitting a Pull Request

Pull requests allow you to propose changes to a repository and request that they be reviewed and merged.

1. Navigate to the forked repository on GitHub where your changes are located.
2. Click on the **Pull Requests** tab at the top of the repository page.
3. Click the green **New Pull Request** button.
4. Use the **Compare changes** view to review your changes.
5. Provide a title and description for your pull request, explaining the purpose of your changes.
6. Click **Create Pull Request** to submit it for review.
